## Installation

You can install the development version of PCAoneR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools") # if not installed
devtools::install_github("Zilong-Li/PCAoneR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use PCAoneH:

```{r example}
library(pcaone)
mat <- matrix(rnorm(100*100), 100, 100)
res <- PCAoneY(mat, k = 10, l = 10, p = 3)
str(res)
```
